// 1.

// Yes its a closue with variable "outerVariable"
// Output - 100

// 2.

// When variables are declared inside a function they are known as scope of that function
// When a function is declared inside another function then the variable of outer functions remains accessible
// by inner function and this is called closure.

// 3.

// Lexical Scope means the variable which are accessible by any function and it helps closures to carry all
// these variables with them (inner functions accessing variables of outer function because of lexical scope)

// 4.

// Output = 3 3 3
